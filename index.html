            Even before the global pandemic made working from home routine for millions, 
            increasing numbers of people had been saying goodbye to their onerous commute to work. 
            Thanks to ever-evolving technologies like Skype, FaceTime, Slack, Zoom, Google Hangouts, 
            authenticator apps, and cloud computing—not to mention texting and email—it's no longer 
            necessary to be in an office full time to be a productive member of the team. 
            In fact, many kinds of work can be done just as effectively, if not more so, from a home office.</p></span>
